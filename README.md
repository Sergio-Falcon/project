#setup
Here is the download for pycharm, it also contains links for linux and mac
You might want to go for the professional version, they have a free student
account.its a free year long, renewable every year and uses your .edu.
Basically, the paid version has more gui commands to make certain things easier
but, if you dont want to use it, you should be able to do everything via command line

Here is a solid tutorial on Python/Django
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/

Here is the actual python download, it contains all the links for different OS's there
We're going for python 3.5.2 unless any one wants to do something different.

#Note
So! once you have python install and you have pycharm installed, you can go to the create new project, and select
the python interpreter, mine was default to C:\Users\Daniel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\python.exe
Make sure you had django project selected, pycharm will automatically install django for you.

Then under file -> settings, there is a search button/tab and type in git, and you can put in your github information and it should be good to go. Note, that I dont have anything actually started though.

to change the theme/colors, goto file -> settings and type in theme, and you should be able to customize it
If you want eclipse key bindings you should search i think for bindings and you can change it to that.
